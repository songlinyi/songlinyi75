  <h1>* Artist Statement *</h1>
    <p>"My name is Linyi Song, nice to meet you:) I am an artist. I think artists are some crazy people doing crazy things.
      They enjoy it and they fall in love with it. In my art works, I tried to find my style to define my own art. I would
      like to observe about nature and recorded them in my art.   "</a ></p >

      When I woke up in an afternoon, I saw shadows on my wall. The shadows are peaceful and flickering like ink dropped in the water.
      The scene inspired my art piece(final project).
      </div>
      Love&Peace
